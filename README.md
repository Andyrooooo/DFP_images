# This is the image upload repo for Desert Focus Productions

### To upload an image, navigate to the top right next to the green button you will see the button "add file". You will click this and it will bring up a drop-down menu and you will then click on "upload files". This is where you can upload files or even drag and drop them into the repository.
### Once you are able to upload images to the repository, you will click on the specific image which will take you to another screen with all images with the specific image selected. From there you will click "view raw" which will take you to the image on another page. This is where you will take the URL, copy it, and then place it in the JavaScript file.
#### If you need to categorize images you made do so by creating new folders
